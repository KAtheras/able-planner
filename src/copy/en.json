It is not intended to provide legal, tax, investment, or financial advice, and should not be relied upon as a substitute for advice from qualified professionals.\n\nNo guarantee of results\nAll projections, charts, and reports generated by this tool are hypothetical and based on user-provided assumptions. Actual results may differ materially. There is no guarantee that projected balances, investment returns, contribution eligibility, or tax benefits will be achieved.\n\nYou may lose some or all of the money invested in an ABLE account.\n\nInvestment risk\nABLE accounts are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Investment returns are not guaranteed, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Changes in market conditions, fees, expenses, and investment selections may significantly affect outcomes.\n\nAssumptions and simplifications\nThis tool relies on simplifying assumptions, which may include constant or estimated rates of return, regular contribution and withdrawal schedules, and simplified treatment of taxes and tax benefits. Actual ABLE program rules, investment performance, and tax treatment vary by state and may change over time.\n\nContribution limits and eligibility\nAnnual contribution limits, Work-to-ABLE eligibility, federal benefits, state benefits, and tax treatment are governed by federal and state law and individual ABLE program rules. This tool does not determine eligibility or compliance and should not be used to make final contribution or withdrawal decisions.\n\nWithdrawals and qualified expenses\nWithdrawals from an ABLE account must generally be used for qualified disability expenses to avoid adverse tax consequences. This tool does not evaluate whether planned withdrawals qualify under applicable rules.\n\nNot an offer or recommendation\nNothing contained in this tool constitutes an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation regarding any investment, security, or financial product.\n\nUse at your own discretion\nBy using this tool, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible for how you interpret and use the information provided.
