        "If a plan account balance maximum constraint is reached, planner logic stops contributions per configured rules.",
        "If requested withdrawals exceed available funds, withdrawals are limited to available balance and balances are not allowed to go negative.",

This tool does not determine eligibility or compliance and should not be used to make final contribution or withdrawal decisions.\n\nWithdrawals and qualified expenses\nWithdrawals from an ABLE account must generally be used for qualified disability expenses to avoid adverse tax consequences.
